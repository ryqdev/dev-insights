# My practice of remote development

## Jetbrains (IntelliJ IDEA)
pros: 
1. Professional programming IDE
2. Development experience is excellent 

cons:
1. The IDE is heavy both in RAM and disk storage
2. IdeaVim plugins is not working properly in remote development

## VSCode
pros: 
1. A lightweight code editor
2. With `Remote Development` extension, remove development is easy to use

cons:
1. Lack of some professional programming toolkit compared with IDEA

## Vim/Neovim
pros:
1. Looks cool
2. Vim offers high flexibility and greater customization possibilities.

cons:
1. Vim is not stable compared with VSCode and IDEA
2. The LSP of Neovim plugins cannot manage the memory well, so it will take up all the memory when the project is large.
3. More time to learn
