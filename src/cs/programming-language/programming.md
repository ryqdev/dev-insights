## Python
Advantages: 
- Easy to learn, easy to use.
- Rich set of third-party packages

Suitable in tiny tool to do simple tasks, but it is not a good language for big projects.

## Golang
Advantages:
- Best in concurrent programming

Golang is the best choice for web development and microservices

## C/C++
Advantages: 
- Low level programming language
- Popular in competitive programming

C/C++ is often used in system programming.

## Rust
Advantages:
- Modern low level programming language

Rust is the good alternative for C++ but the ecosystem is still incomplete compared other languages.
